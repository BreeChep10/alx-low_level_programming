In C, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. A double pointer, also known as a pointer to a pointer, is a pointer that stores the memory address of another pointer variable. This means that a double pointer can be used to indirectly access the memory location where another pointer variable is stored.
The declaration of a double pointer looks like this: int **ptr;
Multi-dimensional Arrays in C:

A multi-dimensional array in C is an array that contains more than one index. In C, a two-dimensional array is the most common type of multi-dimensional array, which can be thought of as a matrix with rows and columns. A two-dimensional array is declared using the following syntax:
data_type array_name[row_size][column_size];
