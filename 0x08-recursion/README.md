Recursion in C
This repository contains examples and explanations of recursive functions in C programming language. Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself in order to solve a problem or perform a task. It is often used in programming to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, simpler problems.

Contents
The repository includes the following:

A factorial.c program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
A fibonacci.c program that generates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
An exponentiation.c program that calculates the value of a number raised to a power using recursion.
A sum.c program that calculates the sum of the digits of a number using recursion.
A binary_tree.c program that implements a binary tree data structure using recursion.
Each program is accompanied by comments explaining how the recursion works and how to use the program.
